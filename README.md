## :beginner: Description
BibLis is an interactive visual representation of various types of lists such as linked lists and stacks, using the WinBGIm C++ graphics library. The data structures were implemented without using the Standard Template Library (STL). The lists are fully interactive and each change made by the user is graphically represented (includes animations). This was a first-year university project.
